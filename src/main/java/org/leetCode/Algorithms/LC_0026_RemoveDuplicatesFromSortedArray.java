	 * Given nums = [1,1,2],
	 * Your function should return length = 2,
	 * with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

	 * Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
	 * Your function should return length = 5,
	 * with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
