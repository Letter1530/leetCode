	 * You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and
	 * S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of stone
	 * you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
	 * The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are
	 * letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of
	 * stone from "A".
	 * 
	 * Example 1: Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb" Output: 3
	 * 
	 * Example 2: Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ" Output: 0
	 * 
	 * Note: S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50. The
	 * characters in J are distinct.
