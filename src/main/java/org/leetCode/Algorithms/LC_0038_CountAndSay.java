	 *
	 * The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
	 * 1.     1
	 * 2.     11
	 * 3.     21
	 * 4.     1211
	 * 5.     111221
	 * 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
	 * 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
	 * 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
	 * Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.
	 *
	 * Example 1:
	 * Input: 1
	 * Output: "1"
	 *
	 * Example 2:
	 * Input: 4
	 * Output: "1211"
